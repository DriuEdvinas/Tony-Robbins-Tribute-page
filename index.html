              participation, massages, a lot of audience participation and
              physical exercises.

            <h1>STORY</h1>
            <h3>
              Robbins began his career promoting seminars for motivational
              speaker and author Jim Rohn when he was 17 years old.<br /><br />

              In the early 1980s, soon after meeting Neurolinguistic Programming
              co-founder John Grinder, the two became partners. At this time
              Robbins taught NLP and Ericksonian Hypnosis. In 1983 Robbins
              learned to firewalk, and incorporated it into his seminars.<br /><br />

              In 1988 Robbins released his first infomercial, Personal Power,
              produced by Guthy Renker, which helped to promote his services as
              a "peak performance coach". The infomercial helped Robbins gain
              wide exposure, selling his Personal Power self-help audiotapes.
              His early infomercials featured celebrities such as Pro Football
              Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton and actor Martin Sheen. By
              1991 an estimated 100 million Americans in 200 media markets had
              seen his infomercials.<br /><br />

              In 1997, Robbins began the Leadership Academy seminar. He is a
              speaker on the seminar circuit sponsored by Learning Annex.
              Robbins was a featured speaker at the 2007 Technology,
              Entertainment and Design (TED) conference. Approximately 4 million
              people have attended his live seminars.<br />

              Together with Cloé Madanes, Robbins founded the Robbins-Madanes
              Center for Intervention, an organization that trains life skills
              coaches to help families and individuals deal with addiction and
              other issues.<br /><br />

              In 2014, Robbins, along with a group of investors including Magic
              Johnson, Mia Hamm, and Peter Guber, acquired rights to launch a
              Major League Soccer franchise in Los Angeles, California,
              currently referred to as the Los Angeles Football Club. The soccer
              team began competition in 2018.<br /><br />

              In 2016, Robbins partnered with Golden State Warriors co-owner
              Peter Guber and Washington Wizards co-owner Ted Leonsis to
              purchase Team Liquid, an eSports pro gaming organization. In 2017
              Team Liquid won The International 7, a Dota 2 tournament with a
              prize pool of over $24 million.<br /><br />

              Robbins has worked on an individual basis with Bill Clinton,
              Justin Tuck, Wayne Gretzky, Serena Williams, Hugh Jackman, and
              Pitbull. He has also counseled American businessmen Peter Guber,
              Steve Wynn, and Marc Benioff. He was named one of the "Top 50
              Business Intellectuals" by Accenture and one of the "Top 200
              Business Gurus" by the Harvard Business Press, and in 2007 was
              ranked on the Forbes Celebrity 100.<br />
